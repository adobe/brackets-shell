:: Prerequisites:
:: 1. Pull down the brackets repo
:: 2. Set BRACKETS_SRC to the root of the brackets repo (with NO trailing slash)
:: 3. Build the Windows build of brackets-shell - see scripts\make_appshell_project.bat
::    (should create a brackets-shell\Release dir)


:: Check that BRACKETS_SRC var is defined and points to a dir that exists
:: (we can't only check the latter since an undefined var is "", which DOES 'exist')
IF NOT DEFINED BRACKETS_SRC GOTO NO_BRACKETS_SRC
IF NOT EXIST %BRACKETS_SRC% GOTO NO_BRACKETS_SRC


:: Folder structure before staging:
::   brackets-shell
::      installer
::         mac
::         win  <-- current directory
::      Release
::         Brackets.exe
::         locales
::         ...
::      ...
::   brackets   <-- BRACKETS_SRC
::      src
::      test

:: Folder structure after staging:
::   brackets-shell
::      installer
::         win
::            staging
::               Brackets.exe
::               locales
::               ...
::               www
::                  <contents of BRACKETS_SRC\src>
::      ...


:: Notes on xcopy usage...
::
:: xcopy uses a very primitive exclusion mechanism. The exclusions have to be stored in a file (can't be
:: passed on command line), and they are matched as literal strings (no wildcards). They can't use spaces
:: (even with quotes), and the path containing the exclude text file also cannot contain spaces. The exclude
:: strings are matched against the absolute path+name of each file AND directory being copied.
::
:: The source path is expected to have NO trailing slash (otherwise "Invalid path"); but the destination path
:: *must* have a trailing slash or else xcopy will prompt to disambiguate dest folder vs. path (unless you pass /i).
::
:: For detailed Windows scripting documentation, see:
:: http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/ntcmds.mspx?mfr=true
